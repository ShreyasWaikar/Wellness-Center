## Welcome guys, you can add your work here.

The current work on automated systems for management in hospitals involves a lot of paperwork and consumes more manpower as well. This traditional way of working cannot store and process the data efficiently and in case of medical emergency, this drawback may become a life threat for the patient. Moreover, this process is time consuming and tedious yet the most important. Therefore, a software solution comes in handy and is reliable.
In this proposed online patient management system, just by logging into the system, from anywhere and anytime, the admin can add new doctors, hospital employees, pharmacists and patients, modify existing records and delete them. Doctors and Employees can login and update information about themselves on the other hand patients can also register in case of emergency wherein the process regarding doctor allocation and treatment initiates automatically. For patients detailed reports about their information can be generated and stored even after discharge for further process.

## Thanks.
